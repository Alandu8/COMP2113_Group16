1. Classical Mode:

Players alternate turns placing a stone (denoted with solid and hollow circles) of their symbol on an empty intersection. One is solid circle and the other is hollow circle. Solid circle plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Placing so that a line of more than five circles of the same color is created does not result in a win.

2. Blocked Mode: 

The winning rule will be the same with classic mode :)
However, you will have a few cells which are randomly chosen to be blocked out in blocked mode. No solid or hollow circles can be placed on blocked cells and bocked cells are not taken into account as one circles in the winning five.

3. Crazzzy Mode:

There is a 33.3% chance that a random bomb planted in a block.

## Game Description

## Game Features

1. Generation of random game sets or events

  - The board is initialised in random: which player will play first.
  - The board will generate a few unplacable positions at the beginning.

2. Data structures for storing game status

  - The program implies "struct" to illustrate the points and use array to store the board.

3. Dynamic memory management

  - When the one/two players give the place they want to put their chess on, one dynamic varible is used to store the 2D coordinates, x and y. After passing the value to the function, the dynamic variable is deleted to free space.

4. File input/output 

  - Input: Using existing board or initialize a new game, choosing between single player mode(play with AI) or double player mode (play with your friends)
  - Output: When players want to exit game in the middle or the game is over, the board is saved in both a txt script file 'saved_board.txt' and a visual-friendly board picture
  
5. Program codes in multiple files
